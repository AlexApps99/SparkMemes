## TODO:
- make this easier to setup eg API keys inside a config file
- minimal disk footprint when not required to save stuff to disk
- add -OO to args to optimize
- proper hardware acceleration support
- PEP8 linter built in
- add --preset flag to keep gh action command short
- no exceptions where it can be helped, instead returning True/False and None
- censor demonetized words on TTS and title, potentially images with OCR

## Usage:
Auth Setup: `python -m sparkmemes.setup_auth`
Command-line: `python -m sparkmemes`
GUI: `python -m sparkmemes.gui` (WIP)
